# Design Document: ExportSathi

## Overview

ExportSathi is an AI-powered Export Compliance & Certification Co-Pilot designed to help Indian MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) start exporting within 7 days. The platform addresses the "Liquidity-Compliance Trap" by providing comprehensive guidance on certifications, documentation, finance, and logistics without requiring expensive consultants or deep regulatory knowledge.

### Core Value Proposition

ExportSathi enables MSMEs to:
- **Predict HS codes** automatically from product images and descriptions
- **Identify required certifications** (FDA, CE, REACH, BIS, ZED, SOFTEX) for any product-market combination
- **Navigate certification processes** with step-by-step guidance, document checklists, and subsidy information
- **Auto-generate export documents** (invoices, packing lists, shipping bills, GST LUT, SOFTEX, certificates of origin)
- **Plan working capital** with RoDTEP calculations, pre-shipment credit eligibility, and cash flow timelines
- **Assess logistics risks** including LCL vs FCL decisions, RMS probability, and route delays
- **Follow a 7-day action plan** to become export-ready quickly

### System Architecture

The system follows a multi-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: React-based web interface with persona-specific features for Manufacturing MSMEs, SaaS exporters, and Merchant exporters
2. **Application Layer**: Python FastAPI backend orchestrating multiple AI-powered modules
3. **AI Layer**: RAG pipeline with AWS Bedrock/Groq for LLM inference, AWS Textract for document extraction, AWS Comprehend for compliance text analysis
4. **Data Layer**: Vector store (FAISS/ChromaDB) for regulatory document retrieval, AWS RDS for user data and reports, AWS S3 for document storage
5. **Infrastructure Layer**: AWS services (EC2/Lambda, S3, RDS, Bedrock, Textract, Comprehend, CloudWatch)

### Core Workflow

1. **Product Input**: User uploads product image, enters details (name, BOM, ingredients), selects destination country and business type
2. **AI Analysis**: Backend processes image with Textract, predicts HS code, retrieves relevant regulations from knowledge base
3. **Export Readiness Report**: System generates comprehensive report with HS code, certifications, compliance roadmap, risks, costs, timeline, and risk score
4. **Certification Navigation**: User explores detailed guidance for each certification with document checklists, test labs, consultants, subsidies
5. **Document Generation**: System auto-generates all required export documents with AI validation
6. **Finance Planning**: User reviews working capital requirements, RoDTEP benefits, pre-shipment credit eligibility
7. **Logistics Assessment**: User evaluates LCL vs FCL options, RMS probability, freight costs
8. **7-Day Action Plan**: User follows day-by-day tasks to become export-ready
9. **Interactive Q&A**: User asks follow-up questions via chat interface with context preservation

All AI responses are grounded in retrieved regulatory documents from DGFT, Customs RMS rules, FDA refusal database, EU RASFF, GSTN, and RoDTEP schedules to ensure accuracy and prevent hallucinations.

**Vector Store Metadata:**

## Error Handling

### Error Categories and Handling Strategies

**1. Input Validation Errors**
- **Trigger**: Invalid product category, empty fields, malformed input
- **HTTP Status**: 400 Bad Request
- **Response**: JSON with error code and user-friendly message
- **Frontend Action**: Display validation errors inline on form fields
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Invalid product category",
    "detail": "Product category must be 'agricultural_products' or 'saas'",
    "code": "INVALID_CATEGORY"
  }
  ```

**2. External API Failures (Groq API)**
- **Trigger**: Groq API unavailable, timeout, rate limit exceeded
- **HTTP Status**: 503 Service Unavailable (for unavailable), 429 Too Many Requests (for rate limit)
- **Response**: JSON with error message and retry suggestion
- **Backend Action**: Log error with request details, implement exponential backoff for retries
- **Frontend Action**: Display error message with "Retry" button
- **Retry Strategy**: Up to 3 retries with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s)
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "AI service temporarily unavailable",
    "detail": "Please try again in a few moments",
    "code": "GROQ_API_UNAVAILABLE",
    "retry_after": 5
  }
  ```

**3. Vector Store Failures**
- **Trigger**: FAISS/ChromaDB connection error, index corruption, search timeout
- **HTTP Status**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Response**: JSON with generic error message
- **Backend Action**: Log detailed error, attempt to reinitialize connection
- **Frontend Action**: Display error message with "Retry" button
- **Fallback**: If vector store is unavailable, return error rather than generating unsupported content
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Unable to retrieve relevant documents",
    "detail": "Please try again later",
    "code": "VECTOR_STORE_ERROR"
  }
  ```

**4. No Relevant Documents Found**
- **Trigger**: Vector store returns no documents above relevance threshold
- **HTTP Status**: 200 OK (not an error, but limited information)
- **Response**: JSON indicating limited information available
- **Backend Action**: Do not generate unsupported content, inform user of limitation
- **Frontend Action**: Display message that information is limited for this query
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "report_id": "abc123",
    "status": "completed",
    "limited_information": true,
    "message": "Limited regulatory information available for this product-destination combination",
    "checklist": [],
    "risks": [],
    "timeline": null
  }
  ```

**5. Malformed LLM Response**
- **Trigger**: Groq API returns response that doesn't match expected schema
- **HTTP Status**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Response**: JSON with error message
- **Backend Action**: Log malformed response, retry with refined prompt (up to 2 retries), then return error
- **Frontend Action**: Display error message with "Retry" button
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Unable to generate structured report",
    "detail": "Please try again",
    "code": "MALFORMED_RESPONSE"
  }
  ```

**6. Rate Limiting**
- **Trigger**: User exceeds request rate limit (e.g., 100 requests per hour)
- **HTTP Status**: 429 Too Many Requests
- **Response**: JSON with rate limit information
- **Backend Action**: Track requests per IP/session, enforce limits
- **Frontend Action**: Display message about rate limit and when user can retry
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Rate limit exceeded",
    "detail": "You have exceeded the maximum number of requests",
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED",
    "retry_after": 3600,
    "limit": 100,
    "window": "1 hour"
  }
  ```

**7. Session Timeout**
- **Trigger**: Chat session inactive for more than TTL (e.g., 1 hour)
- **HTTP Status**: 404 Not Found
- **Response**: JSON indicating session expired
- **Backend Action**: Clean up expired sessions periodically
- **Frontend Action**: Display message and prompt user to start new query
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "Session expired",
    "detail": "Your session has expired. Please start a new query",
    "code": "SESSION_EXPIRED"
  }
  ```

**8. Unexpected Backend Errors**
- **Trigger**: Unhandled exceptions, programming errors
- **HTTP Status**: 500 Internal Server Error
- **Response**: JSON with generic error message (no technical details exposed)
- **Backend Action**: Log full stack trace and error details for debugging
- **Frontend Action**: Display generic error message with "Retry" button
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "error": "An unexpected error occurred",
    "detail": "Please try again later",
    "code": "INTERNAL_ERROR"
  }
  ```

### Error Logging Strategy

**Log Levels:**
- **ERROR**: External API failures, vector store failures, unexpected exceptions
- **WARNING**: Malformed LLM responses, rate limit violations, no documents found
- **INFO**: Successful requests, report generation completion
- **DEBUG**: Request/response details, embedding generation, document retrieval

**Log Format:**
```python
{
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "level": "ERROR",
  "service": "backend",
  "component": "rag_pipeline",
  "message": "Failed to retrieve documents from vector store",
  "error_code": "VECTOR_STORE_ERROR",
  "details": {
    "query": "agricultural products to USA",
    "error_type": "ConnectionError",
    "stack_trace": "..."
  },
  "request_id": "uuid",
  "user_session": "session_id"
}
```

**Log Storage:**
- Development: Console output
- Production: CloudWatch Logs (AWS) or file-based logging with rotation

### Frontend Error Boundary

Implement React Error Boundary to catch rendering errors:
- Catch errors in component tree
- Display fallback UI with error message
- Log error details to console (development) or error tracking service (production)
- Provide "Reload" button to recover

## Testing Strategy

### Dual Testing Approach

ExportSaathi will use both unit tests and property-based tests to ensure comprehensive coverage:

**Unit Tests**: Verify specific examples, edge cases, and error conditions
- Specific input/output examples
- Edge cases (empty inputs, special characters, boundary values)
- Error handling scenarios (API failures, timeouts, malformed responses)
- Integration points between components

**Property Tests**: Verify universal properties across all inputs
- Input validation across wide range of inputs
- Report structure consistency for any generated report
- RAG pipeline behavior for any query
- API contract compliance for any request/response
- Comprehensive input coverage through randomization

Together, these approaches provide comprehensive coverage where unit tests catch concrete bugs and property tests verify general correctness.

### Property-Based Testing Configuration

**Library Selection:**
- **Backend (Python)**: Hypothesis - mature property-based testing library for Python
- **Frontend (TypeScript)**: fast-check - property-based testing library for JavaScript/TypeScript

**Test Configuration:**
- Minimum 100 iterations per property test (due to randomization)
- Each property test must reference its design document property
- Tag format: `# Feature: export-readiness-platform, Property {number}: {property_text}`

**Example Property Test (Python/Hypothesis):**
```python
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st
import pytest

# Feature: export-readiness-platform, Property 1: Valid inputs are accepted
@given(
    product_type=st.text(min_size=1, max_size=200),
    destination_country=st.sampled_from(["USA", "UK", "Germany", "Japan", "Australia"]),
    product_category=st.sampled_from(["agricultural_products", "saas"])
)
def test_valid_inputs_accepted(product_type, destination_country, product_category):
    """For any valid product type, destination country, and supported product category,
    the backend should accept the query and initiate report generation without errors."""
    query = QueryInput(
        product_type=product_type,
        destination_country=destination_country,
        product_category=product_category
    )
    response = client.post("/api/reports/generate", json=query.dict())
    assert response.status_code in [200, 202]  # Accepted or processing
    assert "report_id" in response.json()
```

**Example Property Test (TypeScript/fast-check):**
```typescript
import fc from 'fast-check';

// Feature: export-readiness-platform, Property 15: Checklist persistence round-trip
test('checklist persistence round-trip', () => {
  fc.assert(
    fc.property(
      fc.array(fc.record({
        id: fc.uuid(),
        title: fc.string(),
        description: fc.string(),
        category: fc.constantFrom('certification', 'registration', 'report'),
        mandatory: fc.boolean()
      })),
      (checklistItems) => {
        // For any checklist items marked as complete
        const completedIds = new Set(checklistItems.map(item => item.id));
        
        // Store to localStorage
        localStorage.setItem('completed_items', JSON.stringify([...completedIds]));
        
        // Reload and verify persistence
        const retrieved = new Set(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('completed_items') || '[]'));
        
        // All completed items should still be marked as complete
        completedIds.forEach(id => {
          expect(retrieved.has(id)).toBe(true);
        });
      }
    ),
    { numRuns: 100 }
  );
});
```

### Unit Testing Strategy

**Backend Unit Tests (pytest):**
- Test specific API endpoints with known inputs
- Test error handling for specific failure scenarios
- Test data model validation with edge cases
- Test prompt template construction
- Test embedding generation for specific texts
- Mock external dependencies (Groq API, vector store)

**Frontend Unit Tests (Jest + React Testing Library):**
- Test component rendering with specific props
- Test form validation with edge cases
- Test user interactions (button clicks, form submission)
- Test localStorage persistence
- Mock API calls with specific responses

**Integration Tests:**
- Test complete report generation flow end-to-end
- Test chat conversation flow with multiple messages
- Test acquisition guidance request flow
- Use test vector store with sample documents
- Mock only external APIs (Groq)

### Test Coverage Goals

**Backend:**
- Line coverage: >80%
- Branch coverage: >75%
- Critical paths (RAG pipeline, report generation): 100%

**Frontend:**
- Component coverage: >80%
- Critical user flows (query submission, checklist interaction): 100%
