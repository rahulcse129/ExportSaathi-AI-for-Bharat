# Requirements Document: ExportSathi

## Introduction

ExportSathi is an AI-powered Export Compliance & Certification Co-Pilot designed to help Indian MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises) start exporting within 7 days without hiring expensive consultants or understanding 200+ regulations. The platform addresses the critical "Liquidity-Compliance Trap" where startups fail between GST refunds, certifications, and documentation errors rather than lack of demand.

The platform acts as a comprehensive export enabler providing:
- **Compliance Brain**: Product-to-market compliance mapping with HS code prediction and certification requirements
- **Certification Navigator**: Step-by-step guidance for obtaining FDA, CE, REACH, BIS, ZED, RoDTEP and other certifications
- **Documentation Auto-Pilot**: Auto-generation and validation of commercial invoices, packing lists, shipping bills, GST LUT, SOFTEX, and certificates of origin
- **Finance Readiness Layer**: Working capital planning, pre-shipment credit eligibility, RoDTEP benefit calculation, and currency hedging advice
- **Logistics Risk Shield**: LCL risk analysis, RMS probability estimation, route delay prediction, and freight cost estimation

The platform serves three primary user personas:
1. **Manufacturing MSMEs** (first-time exporters of LED lights, textiles, toys, chemicals) who need certification guidance and shipment rejection prevention
2. **SaaS/Service Exporters** struggling with SOFTEX filings and payment reconciliation
3. **Merchant Exporters** dealing with LCL shipment risks and RMS checks

All AI responses are grounded in retrieved regulatory documents from DGFT, Customs RMS rules, FDA refusal database, EU RASFF, GSTN, and RoDTEP schedules using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure accuracy.
